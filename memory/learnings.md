# Learnings & Gotchas

Non-obvious facts discovered while building. Keep entries short; group by topic (`## <Topic>`). Add one when
something cost more than ~10 minutes or the fix was non-obvious. Delete entries that become wrong.

## Docs

- Line endings in the working tree differ per file (e.g. `specs/lld.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` CRLF; most others LF);
  git stores LF (`core.autocrlf`, no `.gitattributes` rule for `.md`). Keep each file's own endings when editing by
  script. Git Bash's `grep -c $'\r$'` does not see the CRs, so it can't tell them apart: count bytes instead, e.g.
  `python -c "b=open('f','rb').read(); print(b.count(b'\r\n'), b.count(b'\n'))"`.
- Scripted edits through a Bash heredoc on this machine can mangle `…`, `’` and backslash escapes (`\b` became a
  backspace). Write the edit script to a file with the Write tool, or use the Edit tool.
- Git Bash's `sed -i` rewrites a whole CRLF file as LF, even for a one-line change (201 T013, `layers.ts`). Use the
  Edit tool or a Python script with `newline=''` on CRLF files, or restore the endings afterwards.
- A Python patch script with multi-line patterns finds nothing in a CRLF file read with `newline=''` (most of `src/`
  is CRLF). Read, `.replace(chr(13) + chr(10), chr(10))`, patch, write back with `chr(10)` → `chr(13) + chr(10)`;
  spell the endings with `chr()` since `\r\n` typed through a Bash heredoc or `python -c` becomes real line breaks
  (201 T022).

## Tests

- When running a suite to count results, keep its failure lines: `npm run test:e2e 2>&1 | tail -2` showed only
  "66 passed" and lost the name of a test that failed once (001 T004). Grep for `✘` / `failed` / `flaky` instead.
- A source scan for `setError\(` also matches `PresetError(`: use word boundaries (`\bsetError\(`).
- A frame-rate check from `requestAnimationFrame` intervals can't see slow updates when input is slower than the
  display (at 120 Hz most frames carry no move): measure the time between handled input events instead (001 T020).
- On Windows, Node's `setTimeout(16)` often waits ~31 ms (timer tick 15.6 ms): pace with `performance.now()` and
  `setImmediate` when timing matters. And `chrome.exe --version` doesn't print a version there: it opens a window.

## UI

- A menu that focuses its first / checked item in `requestAnimationFrame` (as `MoreMenu` does) loses keys pressed
  right after opening: Playwright's next `press` (or a fast user) lands on the button, and Enter closes the menu.
  Focus in a `useLayoutEffect` on the open state instead (201 T031, the track height menu).
- A `position: fixed` menu inside the timeline's sticky header column was painted under the clip blocks (z-index 2
  in the scroll area), which took its clicks; the keyboard test passed, only a mouse click showed it. Render such
  menus in a portal on `document.body`, and `stopPropagation` their keys: React events bubble out of a portal to
  the React parents (here the timeline's Space / S / Delete / arrow keys) (201 T032).
