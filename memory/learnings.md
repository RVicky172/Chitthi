# Learnings & Gotchas

Non-obvious facts discovered while building. Keep entries short; group by topic (`## <Topic>`). Add one when
something cost more than ~10 minutes or the fix was non-obvious. Delete entries that become wrong.

## Docs

- Line endings in the working tree differ per file (e.g. `specs/lld.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` CRLF; most others LF);
  git stores LF (`core.autocrlf`, no `.gitattributes` rule for `.md`). Keep each file's own endings when editing by
  script. Git Bash's `grep -c $'\r$'` does not see the CRs, so it can't tell them apart: count bytes instead, e.g.
  `python -c "b=open('f','rb').read(); print(b.count(b'\r\n'), b.count(b'\n'))"`.
- Scripted edits through a Bash heredoc on this machine can mangle `…`, `’` and backslash escapes (`\b` became a
  backspace). Write the edit script to a file with the Write tool, or use the Edit tool.

## Tests

- When running a suite to count results, keep its failure lines: `npm run test:e2e 2>&1 | tail -2` showed only
  "66 passed" and lost the name of a test that failed once (001 T004). Grep for `✘` / `failed` / `flaky` instead.
- A source scan for `setError\(` also matches `PresetError(`: use word boundaries (`\bsetError\(`).
- A frame-rate check from `requestAnimationFrame` intervals can't see slow updates when input is slower than the
  display (at 120 Hz most frames carry no move): measure the time between handled input events instead (001 T020).
- On Windows, Node's `setTimeout(16)` often waits ~31 ms (timer tick 15.6 ms): pace with `performance.now()` and
  `setImmediate` when timing matters. And `chrome.exe --version` doesn't print a version there: it opens a window.
- Don't return whole canvases from `page.evaluate` in e2e tests: `Array.from(getImageData(...).data)` took 8+ s on
  the CI runner (no GPU, software WebGL) and blew a 5 s `expect.poll`. Compare inside the page and return a number.
  CI logs and artifacts need `gh` (signed in): `gh run view <id> --log-failed`, `gh run download <id> -n playwright-report`.
