# Decision Log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom. To reverse a decision, add a new entry that says `Supersedes D-00X`.

Format:

```
## D-00X — Title (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Context:** … **Decision:** … **Alternatives:** … **Consequences:** …
```

## D-001 — Adopt spec-driven development ({{TODAY}})

**Context:** Work is done across many sessions, by people and AI agents that don't remember earlier sessions.
**Decision:** Every feature goes Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Verify (`specs/workflow.md`), gated by the
Definition of Done in `specs/constitution.md`; durable project memory lives in the committed `memory/` folder.
**Alternatives:** ad-hoc issues/PR descriptions only; an external tracker.
**Consequences:** Specs and memory are part of every feature's diff; `/spec-*` commands drive the stages.
